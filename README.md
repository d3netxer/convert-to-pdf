This lambda app still needs to be debugged.

You can try to invoke it locally using SAM:

```
sam local invoke --event SampleEvent1.json
```

However the libreoffice command is not working. This is strange becuase the command works if it is run from the command line in a Amazon Linux 2 testing environment.
